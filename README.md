# Degree project
This Github Repository consists of the two prototype application developed for the degree project, conducted by Zaed Noori and Caesar Eriksson.
BarAppCompose contains the prototype application developed with Jetpack Compose
BarAppXML contains the prototype application developed with XML

The purpose of the prototype applications was to compare the UI performance between Jetpack Compose and XML-based UI design. A set of benchmark tests were conducted
in order to measure the UI performance of certain use cases, such as scrolling a list, navigation between screens, and adding an item to favorites list. 
Macrobenchmark and Android Profiler were the frameworks used for the benchmarking and profiling, in order to collect and analyze data and observe how the UI performance
differs between the two approaches.
